Homework assignments for equations of mathematical physics

## Lab 1

You need to create in `~/.net6.0/` input `.json` files:

1) area.json
2) boundary_conditions.json (only expression bodies)
3) accuracy.json

For testing you **need to change and recompile** code

## Lab 2

You need to create in `~/.net6.0/` input `.json` files:

1) area.json
2) inputFuncs.json (only expression bodies)
3) boundaryConditions.json (only expression bodies)
4) accuracy.json

For testing you need to change **only json** files. You can do it without recompiler. Thanks to Sprache.Calc! ðŸ¤—
